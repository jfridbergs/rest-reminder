		<h2> Introduction</h2>
		
		<p>
			Rest reminder is a service tool with the main purpose to help its users to maintain a healthy and productive work sessions by reminding them to take frequent breaks from work.
			The app is based on an idea, that often people, while working, tend to lose sense of time, which sometimes may result lead to fatigue and lower productivity in short time, and may cause health problems over a longer period of time.
			But having short but regular breaks would increase the overall productivity.
			<br>
			The app was initially intended for office workers, who do a"sitting" work and who's work routine is restricted to certain habits and loads on their body.
			But during the development process, the app showed a premise, that it can be used for every kind of action, that requires a longer time for it to be completed.

		<h2> Basic principles </h2>
		
		<p>
			Rest reminder works in a simple and straight forward manner: it counts down the time for periods, when user is supposed to work and when the user should be resting.
			The countdown process can be started by pressing the timer button in the middle of the screen. To turn off Rest Reminder and stop the countdown press and hold the timer button.
			Each type of period (work and rest) has a fixed length, that can be changed in preferences.  When the countdown for active period reaches 0, the app will sound the alarm and/or create a notification.
			Additional features and customization options are described in following sections.
		</p>
		
		<a name="automatic_mode"></a>
		<h3> Automatic mode </h3>
		
		<p>
			If the app is set to automatic mode, it will start counting down the next period right after the previous one has ended.
			This mode is more autonomous and requires minimum amount of user interaction (only required actions are to turn on and off the countdown). 
		</p>
		
		<a name="manual_mode"></a>
		<h3> Manual mode </h3>
		
		<p>
			If manual mode is selected, the app requires the user to start the next period countdown.
			This mode gives users more control on how the work session is divided, but it requires more interaction.
		</p>
		
		<a name="setting_up_the_app"></a>
		<h2> Setting up the app</h2>
		
		<p>
			The app is ready to work right after installation with the default values  45 minutes for work period and 15 minutes for rest period.
			The period durations can be changed in preferences (Period settings subsection). Both periods are set in hours and minutes.
			<br>
			Note: In order for Rest reminder to correctly work in Doze mode, that was introduced in recent Android versions for saving battery, the minimum length for either work and rest period is 10 minutes.
			<br>
			In "Period settings" subsection you can also change the notification sound  for each period type.
		</p>

		<h2> Additional features</h2>
		
		<p>
			Workday Scheduler app has few features that makes app more customizable.
			Each feature can be managed separately.
		</p>
		
		<a name="delay_period"></a>
		<h3> Extend period </h3>
		
		<p>
			Extend period is a feature, that allows you to prolong the current active period or to extend the previous already ended period.
			The amount of available extend options and smallest extend option duration can be changed in preferences. Only first (smallest) option can be set by user. The duration for second extend option is first extend option times 2. For the third option - first extend optiom times 3.

			A period can be delayed multiple times, but after the 3rd delay the background color will turn to red in order to remind that the current period has been extended too many times.
		</p>
		<a name="end_current_period"></a>
		<h3> End current period </h3>
		
		<p>
			End current period allows to end the current period before its time has run out.
			To end current period touch and swipe the area at the bottom of the screen (right side of the screen, if the device is in landscape orientation). 
			Continue the swipe gesture until a message to release appears.
