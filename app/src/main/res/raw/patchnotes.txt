Rest Reminder version 1.1.3
  - added an option to have periods shorter than 10 mins
    (Note: might result in inconsistent app behaviour - delayed notifications. Turning off battery optimisations in device settings can solve this issue)
  - Fixed an issue with misaligned texts, when bigger font size was selected in device accessibility options
  - added an extra hint for first time users on how to turn off the Rest Reminder
  - other minor fixes
